About me...

My name is Bongeka Mtetwa, I live in a small township in Sundumbilli. I love reading, singing, watching crime series and spending time with my family. I am currently on a gap year but would like to continue pursuing my Degree in Computer Science.

I love winter. I love afrobeats music. I'm amazing......I think.
